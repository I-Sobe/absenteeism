# Employee Absenteeism dataset
## a Machine Learning project

## Dataset
The raw dataset(Absenteeism_data) consists of absenteeism data from a company with 700 instances of absenteeism over the monitored period. It consists of 700 rows and 12 columns. The columns consists of ID, Reason for absence, Transportation Expense, DIstance to Work, Age, Daily Work Load Average, Body MAss Index, Body Mass Index, Education, Children, Pets, Absenteeism Time in Hours.
